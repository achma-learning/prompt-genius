Free Photoshop just dropped inside ChatGPT and this is the complete guide on how to use it for image editing - with 50 simple prompts you can use for great results


TLDR


* You can use Photoshop inside ChatGPT by typing @ photopshop, uploading an image, and describing the edit in plain English
* If you need to edit an image this new Photoshop feature in ChatGPT gives you great image editing control over images you take with your phone or camera.  
* It gives you real Photoshop adjustments and effects, plus sliders for fine-tuning
* Best for fast fixes, selective edits (subject vs background), and creative looks (halftone, duotone, glitch, grain)
* Every edit is non-destructive and stacks like layers, so you can tweak or undo without ruining the original
* For heavy-duty work (text, complex compositing, high-res delivery, generative features), hand off to Photoshop on the web


**Important: you do not need a paid Photoshop license for image editing in ChatGPT**


The in-ChatGPT Photoshop workflow does not require an active Photoshop subscription for the core edits inside ChatGPT.


That is the whole point of why this is blowing up: it lowers the barrier to entry to near zero.


**Photoshop in ChatGPT is real now**


For years, Photoshop has been the gold standard… and a psychological warfare simulator for beginners.


Now you can run a big chunk of Photoshop through ChatGPT with plain English:


* No hunting menus
* No remembering where that one slider lives
* No destroying your original file with bad edits


If you can describe the result, you can get 80–90 percent of the way there in minutes.


**The fastest way to try it (30 seconds)**


1. In ChatGPT, type @ photoshop
2. Upload an image
3. Type the edit you want


Example:  
@ photoshop Make the subject pop. Slightly blur the background. Keep skin tones natural. No halos.


If @ photoshop doesn’t show up yet:


* Settings → Apps and Connectors → connect Adobe Photoshop
* Refresh and start a new chat


**What this is (and what it isn’t)**


Think of this as Photoshop with a translator:  
You talk in outcomes, it routes you to the right tools.


**What it’s great at**


Core adjustments


* Exposure, contrast, highlights/shadows
* White balance, vibrance/saturation, grayscale
* Quick cleanup and consistent “this looks better” edits


Creative effects


* Halftone, duotone/tritone
* Glitch, grain, bloom
* Motion blur, mosaic, pixelate, photocopy-style looks


Selective edits


* Edit just the subject or just the background
* Blur background, keep subject sharp
* Make background black and white while subject stays in color


Non-destructive workflow


* Each request becomes its own adjustable step
* You can dial it back instead of starting over


**What it’s not (so you don’t rage quit)**


* Not full desktop Photoshop inside the chat
* If you need precise masking, heavy retouching, text, complex compositing, print-grade delivery, or advanced generative features, you’ll likely finish in full Photoshop (handoff is the point where you can go to web version of photoshop for more advanced edits)


Also: In my testing, export resolution can feel capped compared to full Photoshop. If you need high-res, use the handoff.


**The only prompt formula you need**


Most people fail because they give vibes instead of direction.


Use this every time:


* Target: subject, background, sky, face, product, etc
* Action: brighten, blur, add grain, reduce highlights, etc
* Guardrails: keep it natural, protect skin tones, no halos, subtle


Copy/paste template:  
@ photoshop: subject. Action: make it pop with subtle contrast and exposure. Guardrails: keep skin tones natural, preserve texture, no harsh sharpening, no halos.


**Beginner pack (always works)**


Use one prompt at a time. Stack edits in passes.


* @ photoshop Fix exposure and white balance. Keep it natural.
* @ photoshop Brighten the shadows slightly, reduce harsh highlights.
* @ photoshop Increase contrast a little, but don’t crush blacks.
* @ photoshop Boost vibrance gently. Protect skin tones.
* @ photoshop Convert to black and white with strong midtone contrast.


**One-word quick hits (surprisingly useful)**


* Brighten
* Darken
* Warmer
* Cooler
* Sharper (use sparingly)
* Softer


**Intermediate pack: selective edits (this is where it gets good)**


* @ photoshop Make the subject pop from the background. Keep it realistic.
* @ photoshop Blur the background, keep the subject sharp. No cutout edges.
* @ photoshop Make the background black and white, keep the subject in color. Feather transitions.
* @ photoshop Brighten only the face. Keep skin texture.
* @ photoshop Add glow only to the light sources. Keep it subtle.
* @ photoshop Apply halftone to the background only, not the subject.


**The slider rule most people miss**


After an edit, open the sliders and tune it.


The default intensity is often too strong.  
If something looks fake, reduce it until you almost can’t tell… then bring it back slightly.


That’s the difference between:


* looks edited
* looks expensive


**Advanced workflow: the 4-pass method (pro results, repeatable)**


Run every image through this exact sequence:


Pass 1: Fix reality


* @ photoshop Correct exposure and white balance. Keep it natural.


Pass 2: Separate subject


* @ photoshop Make the subject pop with subtle contrast and background separation. No halos.


Pass 3: Polish locally


* @ photoshop Brighten the face slightly and soften harsh shadows. Preserve texture.


Pass 4: Finish


* @ photoshop Add subtle grain for a photographic feel. No heavy filters.


5 real-world workflows you’ll actually use


**1) LinkedIn headshot**


* @ photoshop Make the subject pop. Keep it clean and natural.
* @ photoshop Reduce harsh highlights on the face. Preserve texture.
* @ photoshopBoost vibrance slightly. Protect skin tones.
* Optional: @ photoshop Add subtle grain.


**2) Product photo for e-commerce**


* @ photoshop Make the product the clear focus. Clean, neutral look.
* @ photoshop Blur the background slightly.
* @ photoshop Increase brightness and contrast on the product only.


**3) Cinematic social post**


* @ photoshop Create a cinematic look with controlled highlights and deeper shadows.
* @ photoshop Add subtle grain.
* @ photoshop Slightly cool the shadows, keep skin natural.


**4) Retro poster**


* @ photoshop Apply a halftone color effect.
* @ photoshop Increase contrast slightly.
* @ photoshop Add grain to unify the look.


**5) Tech glitch aesthetic**


* @ photoshop Apply glitch effect subtly.
* @ photoshop Add lens distortion or noise lightly.
* @ photoshop Keep subject readable and not destroyed.


**Common mistakes that ruin results**


* Using saturation on portraits (turns skin orange) Fix: use vibrance first
* Doing everything in one prompt Fix: one edit per prompt, stack in passes
* Accepting default intensity Fix: always touch the sliders
* Forgetting selective edits Fix: say only on the subject or only on the background
* Treating this as full Photoshop Fix: use it for speed, then hand off when you need precision
