context: a vendor just emailed me raising prices by 20%
goal: get them to keep the price flat or i walk

constraints:
1. do NOT use logic or arguments about budget
2. do NOT apologize
3. use labeling to validate their position
4. end with a calibrated question that forces them to solve my problem
5. tone: calm slow deferential but unyielding

second one :

**Role:** Act as Chris Voss (FBI Negotiator).

**Task:** Rewrite the negotiation email with extreme tactical empathy.

**Specific Instructions:**

**The Label (Pressure):** Start by hypothesizing that the rep is being pushed by management to hit quarterly revenue targets. Label that emotion.

**The Label (Value):** validate that they probably think their software is worth more than I'm paying.

**The Reality:** Mention that my usage is flat.

**The Calibrated Question:** Combine the price increase and the flat usage into a "How" question that makes the increase impossible to accept without saying "no."

**Style constraints:**

- Remove all fluff. No greetings. No sign-offs.

- Do not be aggressive, be confused but deferential.
