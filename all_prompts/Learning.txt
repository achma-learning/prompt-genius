Learning Prompt
This is a prompt for gathering information about a specific topic that:
In the "Definition of Cards" section, the content of "Sheets" and their "Options" are specified.
In the "Prompt Workflow" section, the navigation and movement between "Cards" is explained.
Structure of "Sheet" and "Option"
Every message you send must have two parts: the combination of "Sheet" and its "Options" is called a "Card" (the most important point):
"Sheet" Section: The main part of the "Card" where you place the content I need.
"Option" Section: A numbered optional section at the end of the "Card" where I can select an option number to navigate to a separate "Card".
Specific "Cards" will be defined, each with their own "Sheet" and "Options".
To select an "Option", the "Option" number is entered.
